# Dependencies
- GCC
- Numpy
- Linux

# Installation
- Clone this repo
- Run the compile.py script: `python ./compile.py`

# Using this modules
- Import the main files:
  - array_module.py: `import numerical_module.array_module as arrays`
  - pde_solver.py: `import numerical_module.pde_solver as pde_solver`
- Explore the built functions

# Warning
- This repo is still in development and other functions are going to be added
- Feel free to suggest new functions!
